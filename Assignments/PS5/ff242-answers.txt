Question 3.1: /starter_code/fitness_of_last_generation_on_muir_and_santa_fe.png
              The final generation performs better on Muir trail then on Santa Fe trail. 
Question 3.2: Yes.
              The individuals that perform well on one trail tend to perform well on the other because there are some general traits that allow individuals to get good performance.

              These traits include, but are not limited to, for example, 1). if sensor is true, transit a state where the action is to move forward, 2). if sensor if false, transit to a state where the action is to rotate clockwise or rotate counter-clockwise, 3). avoid being trapped in an infinite loop (e.g., sensor is false, remain at the current state, do nothing, sensor is false), etc.
